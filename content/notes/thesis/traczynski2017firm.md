[Firm default prediction: a bayesian model-averaging approach](https://eds.s.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=2b984d92-27ba-4a57-8855-814ffa7c4f73%5C%40redis)


## 主题 {#主题}

利用贝叶斯模型预测违约

传统分析方法严重依赖于首先识别出违约的因子，存在 model uncertainty

选择贝叶斯是因为 Techniques incorporating  uncertainty  in  linear  models  do  not  immediately translate to nonlinear hazard models

对模型参数进行贝叶斯估计和 Laplace 近似


## 结论 {#结论}

only the ratio of total liabilities to total assets and the inverse of the annualized volatility of firm market equity are robust predictors of bankruptcy and default and that models using only these two variables better predict bankruptcies and defaults for all firms than  models  using  all available co-variate.
